					<h2><b>1</b> Relationship and Rights</h2>
					<p>
						The Company is not a contracted worker for the Customer, and the Product is not a work-for-hire. This agreement is nonexclusive of other agreements, that is, it does not preclude the Company or the Customer from entering into other agreements. Company exclusively retains all intellectual property rights and ownership of the Project. The Customer retains all rights and ownership of their property; this agreement does not facilitate an exchange of rights or ownership.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Sites and their contents (text, images, videos, and software)  are protected by U.S. and international copyright laws. Any content that is not the express property of the Company is used by permission of the copyright holder.
					</p>
					<p>
						Any and all electronic and programmed computer instructions used to provide a service to the Customer for good and valuable consideration are the property of the Company and protected by U.S. and international copyright laws. Any reproduction, modification, distribution, transmission, republication, display, replay, or performance of the content of the Site, unless otherwise granted, is strictly prohibited.
					</p>
					<p>
						Hyperlinks to other websites that exist on the Site may or may not be affiliated with, under the control of, or otherwise influenced by the Company. The Company does not endorse or make any representations or warranties about third party sites or any information, software, or other products or services found there. You agree that the Company will not be liable to you in any way for your use of such services.
					</p>
					<p>
						You are hereby granted a limited, nonexclusive right to create hyperlinks to the Site provided that such link does not portray the Company or any of its projects or services in a false, misleading, derogatory, or otherwise defamatory manner. This limited right may be revoked at any time, for any reason, whatsoever. You may not use, frame, or utilize framing techniques to enclose any Company trademark, logo, or trade name or proprietary information without express written consent from the Company.
					</p>
					<p>
						These Terms provide that all disputes between you and the Company will be resolved by binding arbitration. YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT TO ASSERT OR DEFEND YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THIS CONTRACT. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator and not a judge or jury and your claims cannot be brought as a class action.
					</p>
				</main>
				<aside>
					<p>
						We can provide services and support to you, but we both stay separate and there is no transfer of rights or ownership. We own Caddy and our other software and sites, while you still own and control your property.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our stuff is copyrighted, don't try to steal it.
					</p>
					<p>
						We link to other sites that we don't control, so you can't blame us if they do or say something you don't like. You may link to our site as much as you want (you can even use the Caddy logo properly) as long as it's in good taste!

					<h2><b>2</b> Products and Services</h2>
					<h3><b>2.1</b> Engineering Package</h3>
					<p>
						While the subscription to the Package is active, the Company agrees to: provide Support according to the terms set forth herein; prioritize bug reports from the Customer; give priority, extended consideration to feature requests by the Customer; and continue development on the Project. Any additional services are detailed in this product’s description. The Customer agrees to pay the Company the price of the Package as indicated on the Site in full and on the regular interval as long as the subscription to the Package is active according to the section on payments in these Terms. Customer acknowledges that the Package has a recurring, not one-time, bill.
					</p>
					<h4>2.1.1 Private Support</h4>
					<p>
						Company agrees to provide private Support to the Customer as needed and according to the Company's availability. Examples of activities by the Company that could be counted as providing Support include, but are not limited to: (i) interacting with the Customer to assist with their installation, deployment, or maintenance of their instance(s) of the Project, (ii) answering the Customer's question(s) in a private venue, and (iii) research or investigation into the Customer's use case or situation. While the Company will make every reasonable effort to help answer the Customer's questions, the Customer is aware that solutions might not always be immediately available or technically possible.
					</p>
					<h4>2.1.2 Priority Bug Fixes</h4>
					<p>
						The Company agrees to address new bug reports from the Customer before addressing new bug reports from the open source community. Issues are prioritized by the Company according to a number of criteria; this Product grants the Customer guaranteed elevated priority in the Company's handling of issues reported by the Customer subject to: technical feasibility and practicality, and Company's availability and resources. Bug reports from the Customer may be either private or public, according to the Customer's preference. Bugs reported privately by the Customer may be fixed with public changes.
					</p>
					<p>
						For each bug report ("Issue") submitted by the Customer, the Company agrees to apply its best technical knowledge and make genuine, reasonable efforts to resolve the Issue reported by the Customer. If the best fix for a bug rests with one of the Project's dependencies, the Company will make a good faith effort to advocate the fix or suggest a workaround, but it is not obligated to make changes outside its own Software, including plugins. The Company is not responsible for an Issue if the Customer does not provide the Company with information deemed relevant by the Company in diagnosing, replicating, understanding, and debugging the Issue. The Company reserves the right to continue or finish other work at its discretion before resolving an Issue according to technical or practical requirements or the Company's best judgment of the situation.
					</p>
					<h4>2.1.3 Priority Feature Consideration</h4>
					<p>
						Customer is entitled to request that new features, enhancements, or other changes be implemented into the Project, and the Company agrees to give diligent consideration to Customer's requests as immediately as possible. The Company will give Customer's feature requests added weight over requests from the open source community when planning future work on the Project and discuss them as necessary. However, these Terms do not give the Customer controlling influence over the Project; the Company maintains autonomy over the Project and may decline to implement features requested by the Customer if they do not align with the goals of the Project and the best interests of its Users, or may defer implementation of new features until a time deemed by the Company to be practical or feasible.
					</p>
					<h4>2.1.4 Continued Development</h4>
					<p>
						The Company guarantees to actively continue to develop the Project and to make new releases while the Customer's subscription to the Package is active.
					</p>
					<h3><b>2.2</b> Sponsorship Plan</h3>
					<p>
						Upon purchasing a Sponsorship, Customer becomes a sponsor (herein "Sponsor") of the Project. Company agrees to give the Sponsor access to an exclusive, invite-only community for Customers and Project developers. The Sponsor agrees to pay the Company the price of the Sponsorship as indicated on the Site in full and on the regular interval as long as the Sponsorship is active according to the section on payments in these Terms. Customer acknowledges that the Sponsorship has a recurring, not one-time, bill.
					</p>
					<h4>2.2.1 Brand Placement</h4>
					<p>
						Company agrees to: feature the Customer's logo and link to the Customer's website on the Site; announce Customer as a new sponsor; occasionally mention or promote Sponsor's brand. The Company may use the Sponsor’s name and/or logo at any time or place where they deem a sponsorship mention appropriate. The consistency and execution of these services is up to the discretion of the Company, but the Sponsor may send special requests regarding brand placement to cory@lightcodelabs.com.
					</p>
					<h4>2.2.2 Opt-out of Publicity</h4>
					<p>
						If the Sponsor does not want any publicity associated with the Sponsorship or desires reduced publicity, the Sponsor may opt-out and continue to help the Project as a private Sponsor. Send opt-out requests to cory@lightcodelabs.com.
					</p>
					<h3><b>2.3</b> Termination</h3>
					<p>
						Either the Customer or the Company may terminate a subscription to a Product at any time. Upon termination, all services, privileges, products, and amenities provided to the Customer may be immediately revoked or cancelled by the Company.

					<h2><b>3</b> Custom Terms</h2>
					<p>
						Upon purchasing a Product or mutually entering into any other agreement, Customer and Company enter into the Terms set forth in this document, which are legally binding. The Terms may be amended with addendum documents ("Amended Terms") mutually agreed upon in writing between Customer and the Company. If the Customer has special requirements, the Company may offer Amended Terms at its discretion. Amended Terms may be negotiated before the Customer agrees to these Terms, in which case the Amended Terms will prevail and govern.

						Although uncommon, you may discuss custom terms with us if there is a special need for it. In that case, these terms still apply as a basis for any custom terms, which we will draft.

					<h2><b>5</b> Fees, Invoices, Payment, and Billing</h2>
					
					<h3><b>5.1</b> Acceptable Payment Methods</h3>
					<p>
						The Company accepts major credit cards and debit cards as valid forms of payment. ACH transfer is also acceptable for annual or one-time transactions upon request. Other forms of payment may be approved upon request and at the Company's discretion.
					</p>

					<h3><b>5.2</b> Payment Processors</h3>
					<p>
						The Company uses third-party payment processors for billing and management of financial transactions. The processing of payments may be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the payment processors in addition to these Terms. The Company is not responsible for errors by the payment processors. Customer agrees to pay all charges and fees associated with financial transactions as well as the price of the Product through the payment method.
					</p>

					<h3><b>5.3</b> Authorization and Recurring Billing</h3>
					<p>
						By purchasing a Product, Customer authorizes the Company to charge the Customer's payment method for the price of the Product. Some Products or services are billed as a subscription, and as such, the billing is recurring. Establishment of these Products and services are contingent upon receipt of payment information and initial successful payment through a payment processor that supports recurring billing. Subsequent payments will be automatically charged to the Customer's debit or credit card at a given interval selected by the Customer. Recurring billing may be stopped only by terminating the subscription.
					</p>

					<h3><b>5.4</b> Invoicing</h3>
					<p>
						In some cases (usually one-time or annual billing only), invoices are available upon request. Payment is due no later than ten (10) days past the invoice date. Customer agrees to pay amount due on invoice such that the payment is received and completed by the due date.
					</p>

					<h3><b>5.5</b> Arrearages</h3>
					<p>
						Payments not made within ten (10) days of invoicing or within three (3) business days of automatic billing will be deemed in arrears. For Customers in arrears, monetary breach may be declared by the Company, any relevant termination clauses of the Terms take effect, and refunds are not warranted. Further, the Company may suspend service to the Customer and pursue legal action to collect the full amount due, including any attorneys' fees and costs.
					</p>

					<h3><b>5.6</b> Chargebacks</h3>
					<p>
						You agree to contact the Company before disputing any charge against the method of payment ("chargeback"). You acknowledge and agree that if services, Products, or support have been performed by the Company, chargebacks are unlawful. Chargebacks are considered breach of contract. Chargebacks or revocations on any other form of payment provided to the Company will be investigated and disputed if, in the Company's reasonable opinion, the chargeback is not justified. Any chargeback will automatically invoke the following per-occurrence, non-refundable fees without exception: (i) a $100 administration fee; (ii) a $50 chargeback fee; (iii) a $75 recovery fee. These fees, along with any disputed charges, will result in a negative balance on your account which must be paid before the account will not be considered in arrears. Customer agrees to pay these fees and knowingly assumes the costs when initiating a chargeback. The Customer knowingly waives the right to a refund in the event of any chargeback. In the event of a chargeback, the Company may need to provide relevant information to a third party for the purposes of recovering the debt or for the pursuit of civil or criminal proceedings.
					</p>

					<h3><b>5.7</b> Refunds</h3>
					<p>
						The Customer may request a refund and, pursuant to the Terms, Company agrees to grant a refund on a pro rata basis with cancellation (termination) of services or Product. Refunds are calculated with the time remaining in the Product or service from the point of cancellation. The Company is not obligated to provide a refund and may decline to do so if any of the following cases apply: (i) the Terms have been breached; (ii) the Customer's account is in arrears; (iii) the Customer is involved in any financial or legal disputes with the Company; or (iv) the Customer's request is made more than seven (7) business days after date of termination.
					</p>
				</main>
				<aside>
					<p>
						Payments are processed by third-party entities (like Stripe, and banks) which have their own terms. You should check them out. We accept credit/debit cards for payment, but also can accept ACH transfers for one-time or annual payments.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our products have recurring billing, so when you buy, you are authorizing automated charges at every payment cycle to keep your subscription active.
					</p>
					<p>
						We can do invoicing for one-time or annual subscriptions.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you have a question about a charge, please contact us about it before doing anything else. We can grant refunds pro rata, no problem.

					<h2><b>6</b> General Prohibitions</h2>
					<p>
						You agree not to do any of the following: (i) use any Site or Software text, code, images, videos (herein "Content") in violation of any applicable law or regulation; (ii) attempt to decipher, decompile, disassemble, or reverse-engineer any of the closed-source software related to the Site, Software, Content, or services offered by the Company; (iii) use any Content including any personally identifiable information included within the Content, in violation of any rights of any third parties, including such rights arising under any applicable privacy policies or agreement; (iv) remove or alter any trademark, logo, copyright, or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols, or labels in the Software.
